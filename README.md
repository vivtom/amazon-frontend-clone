# amazon-frontend-clone

This project is a static, front‑end replica of Amazon’s homepage—built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3 (plus Font Awesome for icons). It mirrors Amazon’s key sections:
Header & Navigation: A flex‑based navbar housing the logo, delivery address panel, search bar with category selector, country switcher, account menus and cart icon.

Primary Panel: A secondary menu row featuring the “All” hamburger menu and quick‑link items like “Today’s Deals,” “Customer Service,” and more.
Hero Section: Full‑width background image with an overlay banner prompting users to switch to Amazon India.
Category Grid: Eight evenly spaced product‑category “cards,” each with a heading, background image, and hover effect that reveals a “See more” prompt.
Footer: Multi‑column link layout (“Get to Know Us,” etc.), a “Back to Top” bar, and a bottom strip with legal links and copyright.

Every layout area is wrapped in semantic HTML elements <header>, <section>, <footer> and styled using CSS Flexbox for alignment, %/rem units for proportional sizing, and hover states (borders, color shifts) for interactivity. Background images are applied on empty <div>s with background-size: cover to maintain their aspect ratio, and utility classes (like a reusable .border hover outline) keep the code DRY. The end result is a pixel‑perfect static clone that looks and behaves like Amazon’s landing page—ideal for demonstrating CSS layout skills and attention to detail.
